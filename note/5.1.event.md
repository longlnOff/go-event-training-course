# Event Naming Best Practices

## Core Principle

To sum up, an **event should be a verb in past tense** stating that something happened.

When designing the event, think about **what happened**, not what needs to happen after. Otherwise, you may fall into the **"passive-aggressive events"** trap, where the publisher knows what happens after the event is published.

## Event Naming Examples

### ✅ Good vs ❌ Bad Event Names

| ✅ Good Event Name | ❌ Bad Event Name |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `OrderPlaced` | `NotificationOfUserOnOrderShouldBeSent` |
| `UserSignedUp` | `SendWelcomeEmailIsReadyToSend` |
| `AlarmTriggered` | `AlarmNeedsToBeEnabled` |

## Key Takeaways

- **Use past tense verbs**: Events represent something that has already occurred
- **Focus on the fact**: Describe what happened, not the consequences
- **Avoid imperative language**: Don't tell subscribers what to do
- **Keep it domain-focused**: Event names should reflect business events, not technical implementation details
